    <h5><mark> Moral of the story:</mark></h5>
    <p>Two sides to every story.Someone may seem arrogant,jealous,egotistic.But it will be always better to first know the two sides to every story and then reach any final decision.You may be right but you may be wrong as well.We should never be judgmental and decide the character of a person just by his behavior.</p>
