1> Constructor :- Constructor is a special type of member function 
				that is used to initialize the data members for an
				object of a class automatically,when an object of 
				the same class is created. A constructor has the 
				same name as the class of structure, and does not 
				have a return type.A constructor is invoke at the
				time of object creation, and provides data for the 
				object.
				
	There are different types of constructor, such as:
	
	*->Default constructor: 
			A constructor that does not take any parameters, and provides default values for the data members. 
						
	*->Parameterized constructor:
			A constructor that takes one or	more parameters, and initializes the data members with the given values.
		
	->Overloaded constructor: 
			A constructor that has more than one definition, with different numbers or types of parameters.
			The compiler chooses the appropriate constructor based on the arguments passed to it.

	->Constructor with default value: 
			A constructor that assigns default values to some or all of its parameters, if they are not specified by the user.
			
	*->Copy constructor: 
			A constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object, by copying its data members.
			
	->Inline constructor: 
			A constructor that is defined inside the class declaration, rather than outside it.
